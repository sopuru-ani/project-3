This program's purpose was to create a binary search tree based on randomly generated numbers. The random numbers were achieved using the rand() function which were then passed directly into the insert function. the insert function placed the numbers in nodes as you'd see on a binary tree. The display function then displayed the binary search tree in order, pre order and post order.
